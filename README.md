# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts student performance (**High**, **Medium**, **Low**) based on academic, behavioral, and demographic factors using multiple machine learning models. It also includes rich visualizations such as heatmaps and graphs to better understand the dataset and its influencing variables.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The dataset contains various factors like:
- Number of raised hands  
- Visited resources  
- Attendance/absences  
- Discussion participation  
- Grade level  
- Demographic attributes  

Using these features, the project builds and compares several ML models to determine which algorithm predicts the student’s performance most accurately.
